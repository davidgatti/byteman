# 🤖 Byteman

Display bytes in a human readable format: KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, YB

Byteman is short for "bytes to human" which is a tool to convert a number, normally the amount of bytes of something in to a human readable format. For example `1000` bytes will become `1KB`. Helping you work with big number more easily, and also helping you user understand better what is going on.

# Example

```
let byteman = require('byteman');

let human_form = byteman(10000);
let human_form_decima = byteman(10000, 2);

console.log(human_form)
console.log(human_form_decima)
```

# Installation

```
$ npm install byteman -S
```
