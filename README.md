# Byteman

ðŸ¤– Display bytes in a human readable format: KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, YB

Byteman is short for "bytes to human" which is a tool to convert a number, normally the amount of bytes of something in to a human readable format. For example 1000 bytes will become 1KB. Helping you work with big number more easily, and also helping you user understand better what is going on.

# Example

# Disclaimer

If found this beautiful solution on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15900485/correct-way-to-convert-size-in-bytes-to-kb-mb-gb-in-javascript) made by the user Aliceljm. I liked this approach so much that I decided to make it in to a module, deconstruct the code, understand it and explain it to you.

# Installation

```
$ npm install byteman -S
```
